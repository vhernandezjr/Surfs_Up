# Surfs Up
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval - SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.

##Objective
A weather analysis to support a business venture is required before committing capital to build a Surf and Ice Cream shop located in Hawaii.  The analysis says we need to provide will inform how the typical weather over years would affect both portions of the business revenue stream.

## Summary
For the analysis we used SQLite vs PostgresSQL for the advantages of being quicker to deploy.  Doing this required using SQLAlchemy to interface with SQLite.  Then passing the information a HTML page for ease of data viewing via Flask.  The analysis delivered statistics of weather, such as, min and max along with averages for given time periods.  Using this information, we can see the weather tendencyâ€™s and make informed decisions of peak business correlating surf and ice cream weather to higher foot traffic. 

## Analysis
The month of June and December were keyed in on to identify if temperatures would shift from the middle of prime vacation to the end of year.  Charting out the data we that the temperature for both months are conducive to a shop catering to both surf and ice cream.  Weather on the island is typically consistent for the time period analyzed.
